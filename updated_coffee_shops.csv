It was delicious, not too sweet and with a great texture, the crunchy outer contrasting really well with the soft and chewy middle. The Chai Latte I got was good, and the salted maple latte was ""The best iced coffee"" my mom had EVER had. My sister got the same one and wanted to get another the second she finished it. The interior is also beautiful, with light music and a great study atmosphere. The staff where also super nice! If I went to UC LA, I would go here every day.

I have never been to this Alfred’s before. I really liked the large nicely decorated space, the excellent service, and the outstanding coffee. However I won’t be returning. There is no customer restroom. Unfortunately that is a deal breaker for me. Coffee gives me the urge to go; I always thought that was a common phenomenon. Maybe Alfred’s patrons have large bladders. Or maybe the wear adult diapers? Anyway I’m sad, as I really liked everything else about this Alfred’s location.

I recently had an incredible experience with Alfred Coffee in Westwood through Uber Eats! I ordered the Steak Breakfast Burrito with Chipotle Aioli, the Espresso Cloud Cream with Plant-Based Coconut, Caramel Syrup, Local Honey, and Macadamia Milk, and a 24oz Iced BOLT Clean Energy Drink with Simple Syrup, Coconut Milk, and Macadamia Milk. Everything was absolutely amazing!
I also lucked out with a 60% off coupon, which made it an absolute steal. Without the discount, it might be a bit on the pricey side, but it’s clear that Alfred Coffee is an upscale establishment.
Since I ordered through delivery, I can’t comment on the ambiance or service inside the store, but my delivery driver was fantastic! Overall, a definite 5-star experience.

Tried a matcha lavender drink, it was interesting, it was suggested by the staff so I gave it a try, think I’d still to regular coffee next time. But it was beautiful. Parking is tricky in this area, be prepared to walk. Short distance. No line when we went in, but cute atmosphere, very clean. Very friendly staff. Service was great. Would recommend and return.

Alfred Coffee is a nice little coffee shop brand nestled and originating from the Los Angeles area. It's spaces, as well as its coffee offer, sleek style, finely crafted taste, and superb quality all around. The vanilla latte is a must. The taste is quite extraordinary for such a simple drink. They also carry a good assortment of chaga drinks as well. If you choose an alternative to your coffee game. They carry great pastries to accompany your beverages, and the atmosphere is nice enough to stay awhile and study or chat with friends. Be careful, though. Since this is Westwood, there shall be a steady breakfast and lunch rush for the UCLA crowd and the neighboring hospital. Order ahead online to avoid the traffic.
As of a future update, the coffee is still outstanding. The interior atmosphere is still inviting and pleasant."

I asked for a cappuccino breve with a drip of lavender and. Why do you think I asked breve?! Because I like it extra smooth.
Wel… the nice foam on top was almost missing because they made it fast and not caring that the fine on top is not as rich and pretty as it should be.

I pay for it to have it extra nicely done and good looking design on top! This way I can make it at home.

I’ll try again maybe…
And I ask not to have the top on because I really pay for coffee to enjoy the topping visually and with all my senses….
That’s how I want to experience coffee

I loved this place! I'm so excited they offer salads to go. I got the most delicious ""Brentwood"" salad, a Lavender Latte, and a hot Matcha Latte with honey. Everything was exquisite! Alfred was so nice and personable. We will definitely come back and try their Spring Roll salad, Chickpea Caesar salad, and deli sandwiches.

The vanilla latte is absolutely worth the hype. Absolutely delicious. Had it with oat milk and it was 10/10. Also had the el alfuego burrito which hit the spot. The hot sauce and salsa they serve with it is to die for. Wish I could get that in a bottle. Edit: just realized they sell the hotsauce in store and on Amazon! Getting it asap

Cute little place. Got the vanilla latte (less than half sweetener and two extra shots) and it was tasty. They also have a fridge with more drinks & food. They have a some tables outside and there's trees giving a little shade. Staff was friendly, there was some parking in the back or on the street. It was a nice place to sit and work for a bit.

The baristas and staff here are friendly and helpful. As it was my first time visiting, I asked for their recommendation and they ordered me a hot latte with little foam. They have high quality beans and you can taste the difference. I wish there was more seating available. There was a long line and it would have been nice if there were seats while waiting."

Ideal for a quick break while shopping, it’s a local favorite with friendly service and great drinks.

Convenient location in Beverly Hills, walking distance from the rodeo shops. They have a public parking garage a couple of blocks away and there's also street parking if you're lucky. I wanted to finally try their famed vanilla latte. I know the iced version is more popular but I got it hot. The vanilla flavor is pretty strong. Im glad i got the small size because anything bigger, I think it would be too sweet and too much.

Maya was a phenomenal host and helped us order our coffee and as well worked out our Yelp checkin that got us a free drip coffee all this while being very warm, welcoming and cheerful through and through.

It’s never too bad a time for a coffee or two and if you happen to be around, give them a try!!!

Cheers!!

Had a delicious Hot Coffee with Coconut milk that I loved before going on a stroll in Beverly Hills! Their locations is fantastic and their scones were fresh

Loved the nondairy espresso cloud cream, nice patio to enjoy it outside."

It has distinct flavor and brewing style of their own. This one in century city is a small one with only limited space for dine-in

One of the best Blue Bottle Coffee experiences I had so far.
It is located in the mall, first floor, make sure you stop by for a drink or a croissant!
Although the store is a little bit small and has only 3 or 4 table for seating inside but there are many couches, comfy sofas, and a big porch swing right in front of the store for public use.
Usually , there is a long line but you can order online ahead of time using their mobile app.
The staff are nice and fast!
Make sure you try the almond croissant! It is the best! Not very sweet but super delicious!
Sweet latte and Cafe Mocha are recommended drinks(both hot and iced).
Highly recommend!

- it’s hip and has the same vibes and atmosphere with those in Japan, Taiwan and Jakarta
- NOLA is meh. Tastes like regular latte despite the chicory brewed in.
- Sweet Latte is pretty good. Sweet but not too sweet. Coffee is not too sour.

Normally I love blue bottle they have amazing interior and amazing coffee. This time the coffee had fragments in it and no it is not supposed to contain them. We ordered 2 hot sweet latte and both of them had fragments , which I have never experienced before.

Coffee coffee coffee! Yes, I love coffee! I'm so happy I stumbled across Blue Bottle Coffee inside the Westfield Century City Mall. Since there isn't a Starbucks close to work, this is the next best stop.

When coming to Blue Bottle Coffee, don't expect to get an iced vanilla latte or a frappuccino. No sir, that's not what BBC is all about. They are a specialty coffee roaster offering espresso, New Orleans-style coffee, iced coffee, pour-overs, Tea, and more. They also offer small bites.

My go-to drink here is an iced sweet latte. Since they do not have my fav, iced vanilla latte, this is what they recommend. I'm also a big fan of their avocado toast! It's so scrumptious with an overload of avocado. So good!

If you are a coffee lover, I highly recommend you check out Blue Bottle Coffee."

(Regular hours: 6:30am-5pm).

One week later, same paper on the door.  Not serious for a brand like that.  Few weeks later, again, and even again closing earlier at 1pm instead of 5. Again, weeks later,  closing at 2pm. Again, again & again!

And now, it’s also happening to other locations. Maybe they don’t enough their employees or a poor management.  No excuses because all the other coffee shop are always open.

No other choice than going to Maru Coffee next to the Maybourne Hotel or or  Erewhon on Beverly Dr.

Their NOLA (cold) always hits the spot!! Super strong, creamy and smooth - love it with oat milk

Small modern store with a few tables - more outdoor seating where they share a plaza with other restaurants. Very clean feel

Always grab/go for me here

It was such a great place to focus on my work!! The atmosphere and service were so amazing. The latte artist helped me to bring coffee upstairs while I had my both hands full with my stuff. I would definitely come back again :)

Absolutely The BEDT MOCHA I have had in years!!  Perfect ratio of Coffee to Chocolate , and the QUALITY is definitely SUPERB!!   Highly recommend. Can’t wait to try some of their menu items

Great location to grab a coffee before or after a nearby restaurant lunch or dinner.  Seating outside, inside, and upstairs. Great staff, takes a bit longer for coffee but it comes out done correctly and tastes great. Lots of parking during off hours but can get right during peak shipping and dinner. Recommended."

The outdoor seating area is absolutely stunning - lush greenery surrounds comfortable seating arrangements that somehow manage to feel both sophisticated and inviting at the same time.

I started my morning with their breakfast croissant sandwich and was blown away by the quality. The croissant itself was perfectly flaky and buttery, filled with fresh ingredients that complemented each other beautifully without overwhelming the delicate pastry. Every bite was a perfect balance of flavors.

To complement my meal, I tried one of their custom smoothies - a refreshing blend that was clearly made with premium ingredients. You can taste the difference when a place doesn't cut corners, and Bluestone Lane certainly doesn't.

The staff (Anna & Ryan are stars!) was kind and attentive, and the overall atmosphere encourages you to linger a while longer with your coffee. Whether you're looking for a peaceful spot to work remotely or a charming setting for catching up with friends, this Australian-inspired café delivers on all fronts. Bluestone Lane has become my new favorite Brentwood retreat.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

The coffee was good. Food was kind of bland and under seasoned, but that’s just LA. They had the doors propped open and it was COLD. We dined in but it wasn’t tolerable for long.

One of my go to places in the area to grab a bite and a coffee while working! Make sure your computer is charged but the WiFi works fast. The employees are very kind and welcoming and it’s a bright, comfortable atmosphere. My favorite coffee here is their Magic drink.

Bluestone Lane in Brentwood always delivers. Today’s latte was a perfect blend of rich flavor and smooth textur. The welcoming atmosphere makes it clear that Bluestone excels in both coffee and customer care — a must-visit in the area. Thanks bry for the latte

Walked in for a coffee and a quick Zoom - the wonderful baristas Brian and Anna were the highlight of my visit! So nice and a really tasty almond milk latte to boot. Brian really went out of his way to be kind. We’re all in a strange place right now in LA, and Brian and Anna’s terrific attitude was the best part of my day."

But Bluestone Lane in Westwood? Simple and delicious.

First off, they've got these two guys running the place – Joseph and Eli – who are like the buddy cops of coffee shop we didn't know we needed. Joseph is on top of your order like he's got some kind of savant-level coffee obsession, while Eli's over there making drink recommendations like he's reading your tarot. I'm telling you, these guys might be missing their calling as coffee cult leaders.

Now let me tell you about their Matcha Banana Cream foam thing. Holy sh*!. It's like if matcha and banana Fosters had a baby, and that baby was raised by Willy Wonka. I drank it so fast I almost sucked my own face inside out through the straw. I'm not even ashamed. Though I will say, Bluestone Lane stocks the kind of paper straws that lost Joe Biden, the election. These things disintegrate after the first sip and you end up, sucking on them like you’re underwater struggling for air.

Also let’s talk about the location: Prime real estate for what some might call ""people watching."" The parade of pretty that walks by this place is better than downtown LA during fashion week. I am 100% sure the number of attractive people per capita diverges from the national average college campus. And I didn’t even go to college. I could tell one tourist dude was just sitting there thinking, “attractive” must be a UCLA prerequisite.

So yeah, five stars for the coffee, another five for Joseph and Eli's whole vibe, and about seventeen more for giving me front-row seats to the unofficial Westwood fashion show. My therapist is trying to discourage me from spending eight hours a day here, but what does she know? She still drinks Folgers.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

This place has become a shrinkflation nightmare. Portions got smaller over time, and today my avocado toast was not even the size of two playing cards. Was also supposed to come with poached eggs. Rather than refunding me for the $7 add on, they sent me a box of overcooked scrambled eggs and wrote “no poached eggs, sorry!” on the side. I’m afraid I’m done. I hope this place goes under. I would feel bad for the UCLA students who work here, but I already do: they always seem understaffed and probably aren’t paid enough to do a good job.

HUGEEEEE thanks to danny and alex. I am born and raised in LA and it’s so hard to find good service nowadays. They were an amazing help and most of all super attentive to anything we needed. We came to try the banana crème matcha and they told us it we didn’t like anything to let us know. They were extremely helpful and made the experience all the more better. I LOVED the drink. We will definitely be there next time

Excellent coffee and yummy food. I'm a frequent customer at this particular Bluestone, and am always met with smiling faces from the staff. Sasha is always so friendly and truly cares about the customers. Danny is also awesome -- he makes the best mocha latte! If you need a spot in Westwood to get some work done and have a good coffee, this is the spot.

I love their iced coffee. They're very generous with the extra shot. My order is always right."

The drink menu has a wide variety of options featuring a number of traditional house-made filipino syrups and combinations, such as the Latik Latte or Ube Matcha. The coffee was very strong and well balanced, the matcha was high quality and a vibrant green, and the drinks had fun toppings. The service was great, the baristas are very friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere is great for studying or catching up with friends, with chill house music playing in the background and large windows letting in lots of sunlight. Each drink is around $7.50 and there are no food options yet, but the space is very relaxing and I would definitely stop by for a morning pick me up or after class caffeine hit!

We ended up here after realizing we were too early for the Getty, and according to Maps, this was the closest coffee spot so off we went. It’s a Filipino-inspired pop-up (hopefully going permanent), and the vibe is super inviting. The decor is cozy, making it a great place to just sit and enjoy a good cup of coffee.

I got the Ubeng Ube, which was amazing, but honestly, my boyfriend’s salted latik was even better. The place had a nice, chill atmosphere, pretty quiet, and everyone was respectful of space. The barista was super friendly and knew their stuff.

Wish I lived closer so I could come back, but if you’re in the area, definitely check them out!

Dare I say new favorite coffeeshop in Westwood? Genuinely this might be the best matcha I’ve had here. Ambiant study atmosphere, cute decor, and great location right on Broxton. Shoutout for not upcharging for syrups and alt milks- my $7 ube almondmilk matcha would probably be like $8 or $9 at other places

The baristas of this Fillipino-focused coffee pop-up made this an incredible visit. They’re passionate about their beans, excited to make recommendations, and take pride in their craft….resulting in a creamy and delicious ube matcha.

If you’re in the area make sure to pop in! The space is full of bright light, top notch music, and cozy seating.

I was lucky and helped out by manager Tiffany and owner Emil. They helped to direct me to their wonderful assortment of whole bean roasts which smell so terrific.

I tried out the Ubeng Ube Iced Coffee. After a little stirring, it was an absolute delight. Woke me up and tasted out of this world.

The smile and joy from Tiffany and consideration and care of Emil were top notch. They have speed and customer service down. Definitely over to support local businesses, and this is a gem that deserves to be not-so-hidden any longer.

I'm going to work my way around the lineup of unique creations they have assembled. I recommend to anyone to try them out. Oh and on Thursday's there is an afternoon Farmers Market if that adds to the opportunity. I highly recommend!"

It was a mix of a friendly and business meeting. Both times I ordered the salmon breakfast and the tuna and avocado sandwich – everything was delicious and filling. The only thing I would change in the breakfast is the potatoes – they turn out a bit too dry, but everything else was great. The fresh juices are very tasty.
Each time we stayed for over two hours, and nothing disturbed us – it’s a comfortable place to talk and work on a laptop.
Highly recommend visiting!

I came here for a Saturday brunch after a workout because some West Hollywood locals recommended it. What I didn’t expect? Seeing celebrities in line. Yeah, this spot has that kind of crowd.

Parking
No major hassle. There's plenty of paid street parking nearby, so finding a spot wasn't a nightmare.

Ambiance
The interior? Classic West Hollywood vibes chic, clean, and aesthetic. You can choose to sit inside or enjoy your meal out on the patio. It's a great spot whether you're with family, friends, or on a cute date.

Food & Drinks
I asked the staff for their most popular dishes and ended up ordering the Green Goodness (avocado toast) and the Breakfast Burrito. For drinks, I went with the Strawberry Matcha and the Doheny Latte.

Green Goodness: If you're an avocado toast fan, you'll probably love this one. They were very generous with the avocado. The only downside? The bread was a bit softer than I expected, but overall, not bad.
Breakfast Burrito: It came with two sauces, and the green one totally changed the game. It gave the burrito a unique twist compared to the usual breakfast burritos. Other than that, it was pretty standard.
Strawberry Matcha: My favorite of the day. The balance between matcha and the homemade strawberry purée was on point. I'd definitely come back just for this.
Doheny Latte: This one had a strong cinnamon flavor. If you're into cinnamon, you'll love it, but for me, it was a bit overpowering.

While picking up my food, I found out that Bravo Toast had been providing meals for LA wildfire evacuees and first responders. I think that's amazing, and restaurants that support their community deserve all the love and support.

There's also a Silver Lake location, and I'm definitely checking that out next time!

Would I come back? 100% for that Strawberry Matcha.

Cute cafe with a light assortment of sandwiches and drinks. I had the bacon egg and cheese breakfast item. It was well prepared but on the bland side. I'd be back but try something different. They also have $25 bottles of wine on Friday and Saturday; not a bad deal for a weekend brunch.

Soleil & Harvey amazing people! 🔥
They brightened up my day! 😎
Greeted me as I walked in! 👌🏻
Very generous!
Very cool!
& most importantly very professional! ✅
Will definitely be back for more!! 🔥😊

This place is quite bizarre.
They have decent coffee, pastries etc, about what you'd expect.
My office is less than half a mile away, so I should be a regular as I get local breakfast 3x a week.
I am more of a sandwich person, not into the open face toast - so I went to order one of their toasts and asked for an extra slice of toast to put on top to make it a sandwich instead. Would you believe they refused to sell me an extra slice of toast 🤣

I honestly thought the guy was joking. But he was serious. I said thank you and that will probably be the last visit.

Bravo Toast .......where they refuse to sell you an extra slice of toast."

I had a flat white and it was a decent one. The latte art was cute. The coffee shop carries some pastries too, however the prices seems high.

The shop setup is very compact, a small building with two windows for order and pickup. An open window, especially a small one like theirs, always feels so much more a barrier than a counter and the customers will be aware that they are outside the shop. It's just hard to have the best experience like this. Apart from that, I like the sunny outdoor seating and meticulously maintained office park courtyard.

Coffee was great! Should’ve taken the hot sauce with the breakfast sandwich. But it was affordable and quite good.

You can truly taste the quality in their coffee and matcha. I am a big cream top fan and of the many I've tried, Breakroom's remains unmatched. They also have a great food selection the sandwiches are delicious. I frequent here and highly recommend it.

Best Coffee and breakfast burritos in Century City! Sean has great customer service and always on top of it. Love this place!

I love this place and come here 2x/day when I am at my office. The folks who operate it are cool, the coffee is strong and excellent (I drink cold brew), and the food is very high-quality. I've tried everything: breakfast sandies, pastries, lunch sandwiches, and everything is super fresh and made on premises. They make an amazing Arnold Palmer also. Very chill, consistent service! Ask for their homemade salsa.

Update: the chocolate muffin is soft and has a Nutella-esque center to it. You have to get it in the am bc they don't stock a lot of them."

Large sandwiches and they come with a choice of side (though the side is tiny). The food and coffee is adequate, but unremarkable. Good for a quick bite if short on time.

I recently visited Café Brio and I was incredibly impressed by the friendly staff and delicious food. Among the newly emerged cafes, Café Brio has become one of my favorite places.

Firstly, I was delighted by the warm and welcoming attitude of the staff. During my visit, the staff members always greeted me with smiles and provided excellent service. They were helpful in guiding me through the ordering process and answering any questions I had about the menu. Their dedication to customer satisfaction was evident, and it contributed to a pleasant experience.

Secondly, the quality of the food was exceptional. I thoroughly enjoyed the dishes I ordered. The flavors were well-balanced, and the presentation was visually appealing. The menu offered a diverse range of options, catering to different preferences. Whether it was a savory dish or a refreshing beverage, each item I tried exceeded my expectations.

Overall, Café Brio left a lasting impression on me with its friendly staff and delectable food. It is undoubtedly a gem among the recent additions to the café scene. I highly recommend visiting Café Brio for a memorable culinary experience in Los Angeles.

they have a $10 minimum purchase for parking validation policy. So buying a coffee and a muffin won’t suffice cause a muffin doesn’t qualify. The food items in glass case don’t count. You have to buy a sandwich or something from the menu. I get the $10 minimum but excluding certain items is goin too far. Just give people the validation for spending $10. In this economy you’re lucky to even have a business open. so be grateful to your customers."

They make a fantastic Americano with less water, they are the best of the best.

To witness such great character, heart, 5 Star work ethic, discipline and compassion for the team she manages is enlightening every time I visited this bar for a drink.
It would be a great disservice to the guests and the company to not have someone with such integrity and character be the GM for their front of house operations, quick service restaurants specifically. Their pastry chef is top notch, the croissant filled with cream complimented with their Crema 800 double macchiato is an experience to savor for many at this coffee bar.
Olive Oil cake by the slice is a must have experience! Their espresso cake is well balanced, with a textured outside, softer inside. Lastly, Italians are masters of making coffee, how they select beans and roast them is what sets them apart from anyone.

This cafe is named after Ray Bradbury's novel, Fahrenheit 451. Students often come here for a quick coffee or pastry on their way to class.

The baristas are poorly trained. They do not make drinks consistently well and are rude about incorrect orders. Grab coffee off-campus before studying here.

The staff is absolutely wonderful. Every single one of them was funny and charming. They made the experience great. I love that it's tucked away in the courtyard. it feel like a little oasis. I had a dirty chai and the mango lassi bowl and it was delicious. Hit recommend. Will be back.

Great espresso. Friendly barista. No upcharge for alt milks. Recommended.

Darling little coffee shop with GREAT drinks and food. It's a small shop with no seating, but it's located next to a great outdoor courtyard. A little gem!

Out for a walk and I stumbled upon this gem.  Excellent service and oat latte."

It has enough seating for anyone who wants to study or hangout. Most of their customers are to go orders, which leaves the seats wide open.

The baristas were nice and knocked out orders pretty fast.

I orderd the Latte Amore, it has chocolate covered strawberry with every bit of rich and smooth flavors as possible. Not too sweet which I like.

Everything I would expect for just under $30 after waiting in a fast moving line in Brentwood.

•Latte art on my perfect Cappuccino
•Just the right amount of sweet fig with my yogurt.
•The egg sandwich was so good.
•Blueberry muffin was average.

Look forward to my next visit.

Not sure why they have NO PRICES on anything.  Probably means you can't afford to eat here LOL. It's just annoying.
Coffee is good.  Treats are meh. Their two bite brownies are more like half bite brownie ($5?)

Café Luxxe is one of my go-to spots for a great cup of coffee in a cozy, inviting atmosphere. Their coffee is consistently excellent—whether you're grabbing a latte or just a simple espresso, the quality is always top-notch. It’s also a great place to sit and study, with a calm environment that makes it easy to focus.

The staff is always friendly and welcoming, adding to the overall experience. Plus, there's plenty of parking, which is such a bonus in LA! Whether you're stopping by for a quick coffee or planning to spend some time working or relaxing, Café Luxxe is a fantastic choice.

there is one barista who was taking orders this morning that was extremely rude. I don’t think I’ve ever encountered a barrista that has ever been so unfriendly, and unpleasant. I understand people have bad days but when you’re in the business of serving coffee, you should have more respect to your local customers."

Awesome place to satisfy food cravings.  Pizza, gelato, you name it. For a more proper meal they also have salads and paninis that are quite filling. Definitely my favorite place for to-go in UCLA

Great quick service restaurants catering to UCLA students living on the hill. The pizzas here are the star of the show. The paninis don't stack up to the pizzas. The gelato servings here are very generous; much larger  than other gelaterias.

Probabaly the best place on campus for a very quick to-go meal, especially if you order margarita, cheese, or pepperoni pizza. Very good pizza, panninis, and Gelato. Also has good coffee and specialty desserts.

They have macaroons that you should definitely try! The salads are also tasty but if you feel like indulging, their pizza is always an option."

There is no place in Beverly Hills like Café Sheera. The moment you walk in, you’re greeted by an atmosphere that is both elegant and warm, with floral charm, genuine hospitality, and a sense of purpose that you can feel in every detail.

Their Rose Latte is hands down the best in Beverly Hills — smooth, fragrant, and unforgettable. The croissants are delicate and buttery, and the signature sweets are simply divine, combining tradition with luxury in the most delightful way.

But what truly elevates this place is Suzy, the incredible woman behind it all. She is not just a business owner — she is a fighter, an inspiration, and a living example of grace, strength, and vision. You can feel her energy and passion in every corner of the café. Her presence adds magic to the experience, and her journey is one that deserves admiration and applause.

Café Sheera isn’t just a place to grab coffee — it’s where heart meets flavor, and where community meets elegance. I’m always proud to support this beautiful space and the phenomenal woman who made it all happen.

Amazing hidden gem! Real gift. Especially after seeing a doctor this should be a required stop! Not only a great selection of middle eastern sweets and great teas, there you can have a proper cup of coffee made for you in a box filled with the hot sand. Great atmosphere with an interesting  European soundtrack. Highly recommend.

I love trying new coffee shops for a cup of cappuccino. The place is beautiful, they serve baklava and dates with different fillings and chocolate covered ones.
I love anything with Halva and Rose, so I decided to try them. The dates were old/dry. You can't taste the rose, and the halva was okay with a super dry date. For $5/date, I would expect the dates to be fresh.
The cappuccino was alright.

I had to kill time and while walking around, this cafe caught my eyes. The exterior and interior design was very eye catching. It was a small cafe but had enough space to sit. I tried two baklava and my drink was Iced Date and Egyptian Rose Latte. By far my best rose latte’s I’ve tasted!
Never tried baklava before but it tasted extremely good!
Since this place is in Beverly Hills, the price may be a bit pricey but overall experience was very positive

This coffee shop is an absolute gem! The coffee here isn’t just good—it’s genuinely unique. You can tell they put thought and creativity into their brews, and the flavor profiles are unlike anything you’d get at a chain. I tried one of their specialty drinks and was blown away by how smooth, rich, and flavorful it was. The location is also a major plus—easy to find, with great foot traffic and a nice view. The staff is friendly and welcoming, and you can tell they care about quality and customer experience. Whether you’re a coffee enthusiast or just looking for a chill spot, this place is well worth checking out. Highly recommend"

We ordered avocado on toast, which was OK but the coffee was pretty average and the matcha was disgusting. Also, the service was very, very slow and even the most simple order such as toast and jam was delivered incorrectly. Toast was not toast and had to ask four times for butter and jam.
Also, the furniture inside both the vegan, and the main are very worn down and scratched, and the general quality of the dining room is tired. If you must order - get a pastry to go don’t ever eat in and avoid the coffee. There’s far better coffee shops across the road.

Went for a stroll to grab a pastry. Pics of place and location itself good. Laminate (pastry) terrible and thick. Not sure what flour or butter is used but not a good pastry. Tried three different ones. Staff was nice , location good , pastries not good and coffee served moderately warm.

Such a lovely and beautiful bakery. Found one of the best almond croissants around LA here. Will come back!

Special thanks to Laila and her amazing team for their outstanding service and warm hospitality. The vegan section and options are an absolute dream — so thoughtfully curated and delicious. I love that there’s a separate section just for plant-based items; it makes ordering so much easier and more enjoyable. The staff is incredibly kind and welcoming, which truly enhances the experience.

Wonderful place. A fantastic assortment of delicious pastries and warm atmosphere. Ordered a latte and banana chocolate croissant which were brought to my table outside in the sun which was very nice. Both were exceptional with one error being there was a piece of plastic in my croissant. I pointed this out upon the return of my server and he was apologetic and then returned shortly after with a new croissant and lemonade on the house to vindicate themselves for the problem. It happens not a big deal, I still look forward to returning in the future to further try their selection."

The eggs were great. Perfectly cooked. The bacon was delicious. Great sandwich and Americano coffee

We needed to grab lunch in the area that was low key. There was only a group of 4 before us but it took a while for them to take our order. It took even longer for our sandwiches to be prepared and we didn’t even order coffee. On the plus side, they have indoor and outdoor seating. The bread on my caprese sandwich was top notch. The croissant was delicious. We had to ask security to use the restroom.

Nice coffee shop inside the office building. Convenient. There’s a nice outside. Got a pain au chocolat and a chagaccino (a bit on the sweeter side). The pain au chocolat was delicious!

I had comoncy in Beverly Hills and the service and food was great but this location — which I had doordashed and it was not good at all. I got the grilled chicken panini and requested gluten free bread but it felt like they gave me half gluten free and half not… as you can see in the picture. Also it says it comes with avocado —  which it didn’t come with avocado at all. The sandwich was so oily and it didn’t feel satisfying, there was cheap chicken breast inside and little tomato. So I think the service was poor in general and food was mediocre. I asked for scallion aioli on the side and they accommodated which was great but other than that the whole meal was pretty disappointing.

The breakfast burrito came with avocado, small bits of undercooked bacon, and packets of Tapatio hot sauce. The menu doesn't say avocado was supposed to be in it, and it was supposed to come with housemade salsa."

What sounded a little strange, but it was fantastic. It tasted a little lighter than the average French toast otherwise the service was excellent. The music was just the right volume and very calming. I had a lovely time overall

I had an amazing experience at this restaurant! The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, and the service was impeccable. I tried the avocado toast, and it was absolutely delicious – perfectly ripe avocado, fresh toppings, and served on the most flavorful, crunchy toast. It’s definitely one of the best I’ve had! I can’t wait to come back and try more from their menu. Highly recommend this place for a great meal and a relaxed vibe!

Cute little cafe in Beverly Hills, one of many. Street parking, or you could park on Bedford in the flats and walk down into downtown LA. It’s an orange themed cafe, the service was really good and the owner / cashier was super sweet and patient and attentive and I think that’s what drove the ratings up. I had a to go order of a yogurt parfait and it was good, I wish there was more yogurt and less granola though. But I’d definitely try Comoncy in BH again… it’s better than the other location. Would recommend!

Decent cafe for a few quick bite. Bread is fluffy and ingredients are fresh. Didn’t like the matcha tho, it’s too light and tasted like milk.

Fantastic and suburb cuisine here. I love the tuna sandwich and soup. The chef is most fantastic and kind. What a fun dinner!"

It’s been a long time I came this location. This time was  stop for drink but I normally like their salad and sandwiches.
This time I tried Mint Matcha Latte
What a combination?? I like it a lot.

Love this Seed oil free cafe! I’ve only tried the Gluten-free artichoke chicken panini and it is fabulous. The bread is buttered perfectly! It comes with a tender salad with very light dressing. I also tried the cauli and Mac cheese and that was good too.
My husband had the bistro steak and he really like it. We will be back for more for sure!!!

Nice spot. They serve breakfast until 3 PM. Delicious coffee with seasonal options. Some vegan and great Veg options clearly marked.

A relaxed and reliable spot with a great mix of healthy and hearty options. I especially liked their kale salad, which was fresh, well-balanced, and satisfying. The iced Americano is a bit on the bitter side, but if you’re feeling adventurous, the pistachio cold foam adds a unique twist that smooths it out nicely. A solid choice for a casual lunch or quick coffee break.

Great spot! Good food in a casual environment with great outdoor seating. Can get a bit loud when crowded, but not too bad Highly recommend the egg white bowl with chicken — it was so flavorful and delicious, big portion too. We also ordered the chocolate chip pancakes which I thought were good, but very light on the chocolate chips for me."

Absolutely did not expect a child size salad. And the bblt was dry and the bread was old, hard and had only a small tomato. No mayo, nothing. The loaded potato soup was the only thing good. I called the store over 6 times and there was no answer. would not recommend this place to anyone

They open early and have decent breakfast. Also has power outlets and wifi which makes it a good spot to work on your laptop. Great service by Naomie.

I just wanted a cup of brewed coffee and God-love-em they have sweetnlow! Bathroom UNLOCKED and available as needed. No problems charging my phone for a bit while my daughter was in surgery. Food was fine too.

This is the first time I go there, the portion is very small  are u kidding me is a kids portion. I order the Anaheim panini it taste ok , and also order the pancake combo the  pancakes taste ok but I didn’t like the way the egg taste. I left very disappointed and will not come again.

The worst breakfast I have ever eaten. I often used to eat here years ago but it’s really gone downhill .toCoffee was cold . Anaheim scramble was a tasteless mush. They couldn’t even toast the bread properly . The male bathroom is nasty."

I enjoyed coming here because the owner was so friendly and welcoming!

The prices were good too. I had the breakfast burrito and really liked it and felt like it was a nice comfort food. The ice blended green tea was good and a gorgeous color but sweet for me so next time I would ask if it could be less sweet. Would recommend coming here!

Hidden gem! The food was delicious and the workers were super friendly! I recommend the smoothies (I got the Mango)

I have  been getting lunch maybe once a week from this family owned business for almost a year and the quality of the food, service has been great! The food portions are very generous and the food is very tasty! I would order ahead because they do get busy but even then service is still very fast!

The Spicy Royal sandwich was excellent.  Parking in front was great!….easy and plentiful. But, paying $14 for an egg sandwich I was disappointed that the $20 an hour cooks (plus my 15% tip) were not able to cook a medium egg!   My face was covered in egg yoke, since it wasn’t cooked medium like the menu claimed.   Having lived in So Cal from 1986-2021 I was stunned to see what a fast food dining experience has become.  Kiosk ordering,  minimal staff and the most sterile generic interior I have ever encountered in a dining of experience.  Very sad to see what business is forced to do to be profitable in Cal today.

⭐⭐⭐⭐1/2

Let me start by addressing the elephant in the room: yes, the prices at Egg Tuck might make your college student wallet wince. But here's the truth - after taking that first bite, you'll understand exactly why people line up and shell out for these sandwiches.

The Spicy Royale falls just short of magnificent. And I don’t know what the death rate from cardiovascular disease in Korea is but if this Korean beef patty is what they have for breakfast than it must be quite high.

The perfectly cooked egg with that runny yolk creates a decadent sauce that elevates the entire experience. If egg wanted to be cocaine, this would be its answer. The heat level is just right - just like you want on a first date. Enough to wake up your taste buds without overwhelming the common senses.

I've worked my way through several items on their menu, and I've yet to be disappointed. Each sandwich is crafted with attention to detail that makes me pretty sure they have an Instagram influencer slave chained to the back of the kitchen, grinding these out.

Yes, the ordering system is a bit impersonal - tapping your selection on a greasy screen that has also been fingered by every hungover frat boy within a 10 mile radius.  And then ya kinda wait around with blind faith that culinary magic is happening behind the scenes. But when that sandwich appears, all is forgiven (like a hot girl’s body count).

For fellow students or anyone watching their budget, think of Egg Tuck as an occasional treat rather than an everyday habit unless you’re open to selling feed pics on onlyfans. When you need to reward yourself after finals or impress a previous nights encounter with ""the best egg sandwich in LA,"" this is your spot. Your taste buds will thank you, even if your wallet momentarily protests.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I was very curious to try this concept/place.

Very simple, clean spot inside. You order at the machines and wait for them to call your name. They have a few tables inside.

I got the Avo egg and wanted to try their fries.
This is pretty much what I like eggs, avocado soft bread - so it can’t go wrong. And I did enjoy it! It is a bit on the heavy side with the cream and everything but it was an interesting mix of flavors.
The fries were actually really good - very crispy.

I was just not sure how to eat the sandwich - to make it not too messy.

Overall, a nice experience with something different to try. I would say if you like eggs it’s something to try to make your own opinion.

Got ahold of the Avocado Egg Sandwich, had a very enjoyable experience eating the sandwich it was very creamy and the bread was absolutely fantastic. Decently greasy so if healthy is what your looking for(not for everyone), this choice is pleasant and plenty of avocado (which is rare). I also had their Cold brew coffee, for those who enjoy a more bitter flavored coffee like myself pretty decent choice and should kick off your morning. I enjoy my interaction with a cashier but that’s where it lacks as there is a kiosk instead as you wait for your order. As for the wait I did go around 8 to 9 so there wasn’t to many folks so my food did arrive on a good time. Only would ask for a chance to meet with a cashier but times are changing so no real complaints, I will for sure come back if in the area again.

Yum! Super creamy eggs. Ordered both the basic egg sando and the one with avocado. I prefer the basic one as you can really taste the egg. The avocado makes the entire bite a bit overwhelming. Will definitely come back!"

It's a cute little place with seating inside & outside. Prices are high for the small cups (most only one size), would be nice to have some bigger options. Staff wasn't welcoming at all, and this is why I won't be back. Seemed like they didn't want to be there and I was interrupting their conversation by ordering. So sorry? I and 2 other people had to remind them to give us part of our order that they forgot. Parking is rough, meters or a paid lot it seems. Only stopped by because I was in the area, and they were right across the street.

It is my first favorite coffee shop in LA... it is one of the first independednt coffee shops in LA, too. Their coffee is unvelivable - smooth and soft. So, I started going there over 12 years ago for the coffee, but now go back for the people who work there and the coffee. Everyone is cool and kind.

Even one star is too much for these people. This place is next to my office and I always try to avoid them because of their lousy service and attitude. I figured I give them another try today and of course they did not fail. It seems like all employees are trained to be rude, unfriendly and disrespectful at this place. So many other coffee shops to choose from and believe me their coffees are not worth the terrible service. Never going back .. Avoid them

High quality espresso served in a paper cup: why? Service varies among the baristas from nice to nasty. Nice ambiance. I'm a repeat customer.

It's my favorite coffee place in LA. I've been around a few places, always happy when I come here. The coffee choices is big and they have a beautiful patio.
I've brought all my family and friends over here!"

Hardly any power outlets. Food quality is you get what you pay for, but still decent. Service is quick.

This is one of my go-to places to study in the morning. The music café is near the Hilgard/Westholme bus stop, so if you take the bus to school, it's a quick and easy stop before heading off to class. Its location next to the Inverted Fountain also makes for great people watching.

The staff are always super polite and friendly, and they also have gender neutral bathrooms, which is a huge plus. I'm not much of a coffee person, but I order from here often enough to where I have a regular coffee order: iced mocha with oat milk and hazelnut syrup, which they make to perfection.

The only downside I will say is that, as far as I know, there's only one set of outlets, so if you plan on doing long-term studying, make sure your stuff is charged.

Far better than Starbucks, Peet’s, Coffee Bean, you name it. The Blueberry Pie Cold Brew and The Lucky Charm really impressed me. Their food is tasty too. I love the Carne Asada Melt, which they make right there upon ordering, so it’s served fresh and piping hot. Hats off to the lovely staff who prepare the food and drinks They know what they’re doing!

I came to Farm Cup for breakfast three days in a row on my business travel in LA. The food was great, and I highly recommend Daydreamer coffee! The beautiful scent just made my mornings :) avocado toast, 100/100! Staff were all friendly and helpful, and the seating area is pleasant too. Highly recommend if you stay nearby.

My first time at the century city location - wow. Every detail, from the almond milk vanilla latte to my breakfast and the space itself was incredible! I will 100% be back! Love the vibe. 1 hour parking validated if you eat in.

This daydreamer latte has to be one of the best I've ever tasted. And the flavors and ingredients inside the breakfast buritto are spectacular. Top it off with a very pleasant outdoor eating area and this place is a 10 out of 10.

Yes, another coffee spot! I've been very fortunate to work in an area that is surrounded by an array of coffee shops. Farm Cup Coffee is another coffee gig that I'll add to my list. Don't be fooled by its location as it looks camouflaged within the big business buildings.

The shop itself is pretty big and they offer both indoor and outdoor seating. The vibe is very calm and leaving. They offer a variety of coffee drinks, pastries, and breakfast. The staff is very friendly and quick. They also sell merch and other nic nacs.

I went with my iced vanilla latte. It was actually one of the vanilla lattes I have had in a while. It was so delicious! The perfect amount of vanilla, milk, and coffee. Yum! I'm dying to bring my hubby!"

I like what i ordered. Matcha Chia Pudding is so satisfying, simply wholesome dessert. Chai latte is just right, not too strong not too sweet. Fritatta is delicious. The Paninni is tasty. The ambiance reminds me of little cafe in NYC. Service is great and fast.

One of our very favorite places in LA for espresso and memorable pastries and small dishes, especially for early AM or lunch. The people watching is just as good! We like to sit outside with our dog and enjoy the well crafted, thoughtful Italian coffee and food. We love the cappuccino, and we order the croissant and some bombolinos, then take some prosciutto and tiramisu to go. Highly recommend

Came strictly for an iced matcha latte with almond milk to go. The staff was very friendly, but the matcha was ready before I even paid, leading me to believe that it’s just a pre-batched mix. I can’t even taste a hint of matcha anywhere, it just tastes like watered down almond milk. Huge waste of $8.50.

Cute cafe in downtown Beverly Hills — there’s indoor and outdoor seating and the whole vibe is super cute and relaxing. I got the avocado toast with gluten free focaccia bread and egg  and an iced matcha latte with low fat milk. I had a pick up order for 8:30 am but I think they received it late so I had to wait 15 more minutes. I didn’t mind bc the customer service was good and they were really friendly. The avocado toast was pretty good with the focaccia and I liked that they have gluten free options for bread. The portion size was perfect, I liked that they added walnuts to the avo toast. I wish I asked for no salt though bc I could taste it on the egg. As I mentioned before The service was great, the workers were super kind and warm and welcoming and the customer service was excellent. It made the cafe experience better. The matcha latte wasn’t the best — I think it’s typical cafe matcha and there’s definitely better matcha out there; it tasted very milky. But overall I’d go back again for the service and the food, don’t know if I’ll ever the matcha again but would be open to trying other beverages in their menu.

Staff is very nice and food and coffee were great! We sat down outside with our dog after walking along Rodeo Drive"

What a cute and classy restaurant/café. Many vegan & gluten free options and all the ingredients were so fresh! The mirrored dining area feels so spacious and there's even a small outdoor patio area. LA is in short supply of good breakfast places open in the morning, especially with vegan/vegetarian options. These guys are doing it right! Can wait to go back.

I was handling some business in the area, and decided to stop into Gravitè to get a healthy lunch. The food was so good! It was very healthy, and clean while also offering wonderful flavors. It’s a cute little place with charm. I loved the lighting fixture that looked like the inner working’s of a clock. Very unique. There was a little seating area outside with beautiful plants, and flowers, as well. The staff were so professional, and polite. The energy in the cafe was so warm, and inviting. The gentleman who brought us our food was oozing with happiness, and he seemed incredibly happy to hear we loved the food so much. You know, you can always find a place that has delicious food but you don’t always find a place where the staff, possibly the owner, are as excited about your experience there as you are. The area felt fine to me. In fact, we walked there from a few blocks away. I will eat here every time I’m in the area. Like their sign says, “Eat, Heal, Love”.

I have been to this spot on Sunset Blvd a few times since they have reopened. The employees are very sweet and have great recommendations! My favorites include; the Spanish latte and the potion smoothie. They also have a tasty chicken avo panini that comes with a side salad. Highly recommend stopping by if you are in the area!

I had the breakfast hash and the Spanish latte. The hash was so delicious and packed with all sorts of veggies, I would definitely recommend. The Spanish latte was delightful and very tasty. I love the ambiance here and it wasn’t crowded on a Saturday morning. Really lovely cafe!"

Truly fantastic selection of delicious pastries, including an awesome blueberry scone! For a business meeting, I bought a box of about 20 various pastries. Beautiful and relaxed atmosphere, and the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. You can even park right at the front door for a quick pickup. Highly recommended!

Don't let the overhead neon-lights bother you.  This is real, not contrived. Toasted curry sandwich was delicious, not too heavy

It ended up being as good as it looked online - I had the tuna avocado sandwich and my husband had the club and they both were delicious.  The sandwiches were flavorful and the bread was delightfully crunchy!
We also ordered a chocolate protein drink. It was not super sweet or super chocolately...so for me it was just Okay but my husband liked it a lot. I also got the Iconic Tonic and that was good but the drink cost over $16 alone with tax...that's a too expensive in my opinion.  On price alone..I probably would never buy that drink again. Overall, it was still a good experience.  I definitely recommend for others to try this place out if you are in the area.  I hope they expand out to Orange County.

the atmosphere and decor of this place are lovely, and the vanilla matcha was extremely delicious as well! however, the servers never seem to ask us for the size of the drink, and default to the largest size. when you ask them to change, they are pretty rude about it. other than that, the drink itself was tasty.

I recently revisited Joe & The Juice at their Melrose location, and wow—what a turnaround! The sandwiches and smoothies were not only delicious but also prepared swiftly. The staff was friendly, and the atmosphere had a vibrant, welcoming vibe. It’s clear they’ve stepped up their game, making it a go-to spot for a quick, healthy bite. ￼

Bowl wasn't bad but not the greatest either. What bothered me more was the service..pretty passive aggressive workers and just fake in trying to help. It was my first time there and not quite sure how it all works paying via the app and all and I just wanted a refund so I can pay with a different card it was such a pain to do where I feel like it's something pretty simple and easy like all other places. They already lost my business and my friends before it has even begun.

Tried the turkey sandwich literally reminds me of my favorite thing-Thanksgiving dinner. Loved it a lot maybe even more than Tunacado tbh..  Christian always makes it so so good shoutsout to him for making the atmosphere A1. Always special to see, big big matcha energy always"

I checked out this coffee spot that he went to almost every day when he was going to college I got to admit it is a wonderful vibe. They have a beautiful courtyard. The service is great. Everyone's really nice. It's a lot of students who are studying and preparing for class but I kinda like that. It makes for a great work environment when I need to hammer some things out on my computer.

I’ve studied hear many times as a student and really enjoy the coffee and atmosphere of this place. It is always the perfect amount of bustling, with great music playing, pleasant ambient conversation, and the perfect temperature year-round. I’ve had interviews, study sessions, and done homework here. Menu is great and not too pricey, they also accept dorm vouchers!

Nice little coffee house in the middle of the campus.   Nothing special, lots of pre packaged food although they can do toasted bagels etc, but the coffee was good and the food was fine.  Very small area to sit indoors but lots of space outdoors.

Love this coffee house. It’s perfect when you want a great cup of coffee and a small snack. It is quiet and great for studying. It is comfy and the staff are great.

I like the vibe of the area but its pretty full with a medium sized line. Got a regular iced coffee and it was not great, much cheaper than other places on campus and i still feel like i wasted the $3 spent on it"

The owners are the sweetest couple you’ll ever meet, the food and drinks are impeccable, and the ambiance is like a little hidden oasis smack dab in the middle of Beverly Hills. Do yourself a favor and try one of everything. Oh, AND they cater!

Great food, wonderful service, and good vibes. The sandwiches and sakshuka were spicy and yummy. The coffee was strong and smoothie delicious.  The chef does a great job and also goes between tables. His wife manages everything, and they do a great job. The place is packed at noon, but it's really worth waiting for. The salads they sell to go are fantastic.

Hidden gem cafe in the heart of Beverly Hills. Leora cafe is inside the UTA but it’s easy guided with signs to get there. Just park on Civic Center Dr 9346, and by little steps  you’ll find the first sign. And from there just follow the signs! Food is delicious! They offer coffee, lunch, brunch, snack and even fresh fruit. What I love about their website is Daily Specials being updated literally daily with a date. It has indoor and outdoor sitting. Great ambience! I had a Mushroom Fajitas Salad and it was big and yummy. Very fulfilling. They have vegan options on the menu as well as vegan cookies and snacks. I highly recommend it!

LEORA is my new favorite restaurant in Los Angeles. They have everything you could possibly want in a restaurant. The food is delicious, made with the highest quality ingredients, staff is incredibly nice and wants you to have the best experience possible, food comes out perfectly and tastes even better than it looks, restaurant is clean & decorated very well. I will be back weekly and would definitely recommend trying cafe LEORA. Owner & chef Leeor was also incredible and made our experience even more enjoyable. This is the type of restaurant where everything is incredible and you can’t go wrong with any dish. Also- try their daily special as it is always incredible. A must try, could not have had a better experience.

My first time here and I had a little delay with my coffee and the owner tried to make it right by kindly giving me a pastry. Both the coffee and the pastry we're excellent. The atmosphere here is also a very chill one The service from the owner to this staff is second to none. This coffee shop is definitely a gem."

This statement from company profile.
When you visit this branch baristas so friendly coffee shop worth going.

Where is the rest of the coffee?
It’s not the size of the cup but the content that defines large or small, giving me a large cup with just half the coffee doesn’t make it large. I did pay for the large.

They close at 6pm not 7pm. I've been looking for the S'mores flavored and since they closed the Silverlake one, this one was the closest but they closed an hour early. My disappointment is immeasurable :(

Friendly people and a nice place to go to if you're waiting for people.

I was hoping for better coffee but it's pretty much 2nd wave coffee. No go for me but for an older crowd maybe.

Although I’m a big fan of La Colombe, this particular location fell short. The service was impersonal, pretentious, and outright rude. The baristas had an attitude when we ordered our pumpkin chai and a regular decaf latte. The decaf latte was far too strong, and when we politely asked for a remake, the barista’s response was less than welcoming. Unfortunately, the remake was just as disappointing. Overall, we didn’t have the best experience at this La Colombe."

Highly recommend this place. They have an assortment of draft beverages which I love, as well as a selection of unique beverages and pastries, of which I have tried almost all of. The financier is my top pick.  They have a section of grab and go beverages as well as bags of their roasted coffee. Lots of seating inside and comforting vibes. Will be back for sure.

Coffee is great, pastries are as expected, ambience is cool and parking not easy.

I got a pour over and they were decent enough to check if I wanted it ""for here"". I never like pour over in a ""to go"" cup but I keep forgetting to point it out when ordering, so thanks for checking. I sat down for half an hour and the sitting area while hip looking is not super comfortable.

I got a bag of the beans from the coffee I tried and if I am in the area again, I'll definitely stop by, hoping to find parking easily.

A pretty average coffee shop — wooden, comfortable and classy cabin vibes inside. I came around noon and the pastries were nearly all Gone. This is based off of the chocolate cookie I had - it was flat and HUGE. It was sweet, it was good. An average coffee shop chocolate chip cookie. There’s plenty of seating indoors with outlets against the wall. I like the vibes - would come here to do work.

Long wait for an average coffee, nothing special, even though I ordered best-seller/famous coffee as suggested. Quality and taste were ok, 3/5. Understaffed and hopefully can improve on this.
The overall ambiance looks friendly with open space.

Excellent cup of coffee.  Oat milk available.  My only regret is that I ordered a small.   The vegan pastry is delicious.  The price point is predictable for Beverly Hills.
The employees are cheerful, professional and helpful.  While not spacious, the digs are comfortable and inviting."

I tried it & it was delicious ! It was a bit salty towards the end but as long as you have the baguette you’re good to go. Will definitely be back to try out their pastries & coffees!

I recently stopped by this lovely bakery in Beverly Hills, and I have to say, it’s a hidden gem! My friend, who has been a loyal customer for years, recommended it to me, and I’m so glad she did. I visited once last year, and while I was in the area this morning, I couldn’t resist returning for their excellent coffee. The coffee alone is worth the trip, but they also have a wide selection of delicious- pastries.  I’ve heard great things about their breakfast options, and their baguettes are supposed to be excellent.

The bakery offers indoor and outdoor seating, making it a cozy, relaxing spot to enjoy your meal. Free parking is available, which is a massive plus in Beverly Hills!

I highly recommend stopping by if you’re in the area!

Rated one of the best French bakeries in Beverly hills. But don't just go for the delicious cookies, pastries and baked goods, because their breakfast and lunch menu is just as fresh and delicious. Plenty of outdoor seating. The shopping center had 2 levels of parking

I have been coming to this place for years and it only keeps on getting better. The service is amazing and the food is sooooo gooooood! Their food always tastes fresh and their sweets are sweet and I can eat all of them without any complaints.
I recently tried their egg Benedict and it is noe my favorite.

A really good breakfast spot with quick service and fair prices. You order at the counter, take a number and the staff brings it out to you, you will not have a set waiter. They don’t have many seating options inside, but have a lot outside. They have a ton of bakery options and their food is very good, although smaller in portion size. Parking is extremely easy as they have a parking lot right in front or free underground parking for the same building.

We ordered the Honey Butter Croissants which were absolutely delicious. Sticky and tasty and a great treat. We also ordered the French Ham Benedict, which tasted great, but was small in portion size. I added avocado as well which i definitely recommend. We ordered Egg White Bacon Cheddar Cheese Sandwich and we subbed a croissant instead of baguette. It too was great and we would both order our dishes again.

Overall a fairly priced and solid breakfast option in Beverly Hills. I plan to be back soon to try more items."

The sandwich and salad were both incredibly fresh, with the bread clearly baked in-house.
The mushroom ricotta flatbread was another standout. A must-try if you’re visiting!

Le Pain Quotidian is one of my favorite chains. The quality of the coffee and food is excellent. I stopped in here on a cross-city trip and ordered a latte and a croissant. The croissants are some of the best I’ve ever had: flaky, soft but firm on the outside. A true delight. The baked goods are not slathered in sugar which is a welcome change from the usual coffee shop suspects. There’s also a couple actual cooked items on the menu you can order. The employees were all really kind, the seating area was clean, and the bathrooms were clean. Would definitely come by again next time I’m in the area.

Loved eating here, the mini Dutch pancakes and crookie were DELICIOUS and the waiter was super attentive and sweet.

However, I don’t recommend getting the avocado tartine. It’s quite expensive for very few toppings and not very much avocado.

Perfect start in the day!
Our breakfast at Le Pain Quotidien was a tasteful experience. The diverse menu offered delicious twists on breakfast classics, satisfying all tastes. What truly stood out was the kindness of the staff. From the warm welcome to their attentive service, every moment felt genuinely welcoming.

The Avocado Toast, was served promptly and a perfect blend of flavors. The staff's enthusiasm and helpful recommendations added an extra layer of joy to our morning.
Great start in the day!

I've been multiple times to Le Pain Quotidien while in São Paulo. The service is consistently great across all units I've been to. The unit in LA, near UCLA,  is quite nice. The service was fast, even though the place was full. Our server was friendly and attentive.

As someone who avoids ultra processed foods, I appreciate the focus on wholesome and delicious dishes and drinks with careful selection of ingredients.

I also find it quite nice to finish up a meal spreading a bit of jam on a slice of scrumptious bread.  I love that they have jams around the restaurant for the costumers to help themselves."

The amazing service is a key reason why we love it here, especially since the chef is willing to adjust most meals to accommodate a gluten-free diet. The food and coffee are absolutely delicious; everything I ordered was truly five-star. We must emphasize how fantastic the service is, particularly from Cindy, who always goes above and beyond to ensure that each experience is perfect.

This French cafe is an absolute gem! The coffee was rich and aromatic, truly a perfect brew that hits the spot. Their cream donuts were out of this world—soft, fresh, and filled with the most delicious cream. The bakery selection was just as impressive, with everything tasting fresh and expertly crafted.

What made the experience even better was the lovely ambiance. Soft classic music played in the background, creating a serene and sophisticated atmosphere. To top it off, I loved seeing a few patrons engrossed in friendly games of chess—it gave the place a warm, communal feel. This cafe is a perfect spot for relaxing, savoring great food, and enjoying a little slice of French culture. Highly recommend!

Belgian chocolate coffee is amazing! Croissants with cookie dough and s'mores were fantastic and something I've never tried before! Server was very nice! Highly recommend!!!

Le Pain Quotidien is a gem! The ambiance is warm and inviting, perfect for relaxing or catching up with friends & family. The food is exceptional, with fresh, high-quality ingredients and delicious flavors in every dish. The service is outstanding—attentive, friendly, and efficient. Their coffee and pastries are particularly delightful. Whether you're stopping by for breakfast, lunch, or a casual coffee break, Le Pain Quotidien never disappoints. Highly recommended!

Very good place to have a breakfast ..
Quality is so good .. fresh croissants ..
And most to mention that their cappuccino is perfect ❤️ .."

The new menu is great. The new hours are great. The staff is great (*way* less turnover). Fantastic option to have in the building.

When the cafe first opened, it went through a rough time of getting the right order and preparing food on time. After months of adjustments, I think the place is pretty solid and the management is trying hard to please everyone. They have good selections of food for everyone from fresh salad bar to entre fancy entree.

This place is really great! I work at the building right next to it so i am a regular.
The employees are always really nice and welcoming.
The cheese omelet with a side of greens is always really good for breakfast or a cheese burrito with potatoes inside. Really good!
For lunch, i recomment the chicken sandwich that they offer with pesto and mozarella cheese. Its delicious, especially when you order a side of the chipotle crema.
Aside from that the morning oatmeal is really good for a lite breakfast and the occasional pineapple juice is to die for!

On top of all of this they usually have your order ready in a timely manner and their prices are really affordable. A must try!

The staff members are great 👍 . Food is excellent .
As for the mangers : 👎.
To be put on board and then let go is just like unethical . Very unoriginzed , not friendly , k don’t appreciate the manger that have the position there . I try and contact hr or cooperate they don’t want to HELP with that it’s like there lost in commutation . She RAY THE MANGER would tell me to hang tight and never would here from her . I’ve never have felt with this or been drop so quick from a job when I didn’t even get to see my skills . Shows to me they don’t want an African American worker

It's the cafe of last resort due to high cost for that you actually get."

Awesome place that has been around since the 50's. Food is good, and the place is a vibe. Shout-out to the super attentive waitress girl Gemma, you're awesome!

Old time coffee shop with a full menu. Please come here so this place stays open. Have an omelette. Or a burger. Great service. Homey atmosphere. You can on Mary and Robb's being the same every time, and we like it that way!

A delicious diner in Westwood. It’s been open since 1967, and has a lot of history associated with it. It’s very large on the inside with many different seating options. Inside is designed like a traditional retro diner, which I personally love. We were able to be seated right when we arrived and service was very fast. They don’t have a dedicated parking lot so it will be metered street parking.

They have a very large menu filled with all the American diner classics. For my first time I chose the Chili Omelette Supreme and honestly really loved it. It was a very large omelette filled with a very meaty chili and it really hit the spot. The avocado on top was a great addition. We also tried the traditional breakfast, and the pancakes were especially good.

Overall a really solid diner option in a nice part of town. I would recommend to any breakfast fan and I plan to be back in the future to try more dishes.

Looking for a dine in place with breakfast pancakes. Found this place and very happy.

Quality food along with great attentive service. Restaurant was able to make my Blueberry pancakes 🥞 delicious.

The mimosas are on point 👌🏼.

The restaurant is near Westwood and Ohio. South of Wilshire.

Peaceful and spacious, especially on a Sunday morning when it wasn’t busy at all. There’s plenty of room both indoors and outdoors, and the menu offers a wide variety of options. I genuinely enjoyed my visit, and it made for a perfect start to the day, especially paired with my morning read.

Such a lovely coffee shops with good food options. It is located at Westwood by UCLA. After a certain time finding a table becomes  a challenge. Parking in the area is also difficult. There is a close by parking garage.
The coffee, ambiance and food selections are all good.

Update: the food and service continue to be really good. We tried different breakfast items this time. Both were fresh and tasty

I was in LA few weeks ago for twelve days and this is on of my favorite spot for sure. Live the location in Westwood in the UCLA area. Very quiet and relaxing area in the huge LA, I loved walking there and enjoying breakfast. The vibes are great with so many your people around that took me back the university time! Very good coffee and food in general, croissants, sandwiches, toasts etc. Staff is extremely kind and welcoming and it was a pleasure spending time there working and relaxing a bit. I f you need groceries the location is perfect since at few steps there are Target and Trader Joe’s! Strongly recommended!

I only try their coffee there, but it’s so cute. I love the yellow colors and the lattes are pretty good."

Go to Bagels Always by the Asiago with jalapeno cream cheese I always buy a dozen best bagels

No, I usually don’t do reviews like this but today just really rub me the wrong way. I walked into Noah’s bagels early this morning maybe about 10 o’clock and mind you I’m a person of color and when I walked in and I ordered ice specifically for a jalapeño cheddar bagel, I did tell them that I was allergic to salmon so they could not cross contaminate, and I also ordered a blueberry muffin, proceeded to my bag to find a completely different bagel than what I ordered as well as there were chunks of salmon in my bagel, and I had asked for very light cream cheese and for my bagel to be double toasted they didn’t toast my bagel at all. very disappointed and they kind of gave me the cold shoulder while being very nice to all the other customers being the same race as them.

I want to tell the event I experienced here, in fact, I was not going to write this incident here, but I wanted to write this nonsense here because the woman in this incident showed me the absurd behavior she did as if I did it. I came to pick up the customer’s order, I asked the woman who was going to give me the order to the password of the toilet, for some reason, since she had a job in her hand, she couldn’t do her job and tell me the password, so I thought she couldn’t talk in time, I didn’t care much. Then he went to the toilet, he didn’t tell me to follow me or I’ll open the door of the toilet to you, he went to the toilet, he came back, then he showed an attitude on his face as if I put me in his place of an idiot as if I didn’t follow him. Actually, that stupid attitude was completely his own because he didn’t give me a command like follow me on the way there, I was waiting for him where I was, I want to call him from here instead of putting people in the place of fools and instead of putting such a fast expression, you should try to talk to people because from a distance you look like an idiot. First you have to go to a conversation course first and when someone else asks you a question while doing a job, you shouldn’t answer it either. You should definitely improve both of these situations in yourself."

Small portions for a high price. What you get is pretty good though.

This place has fallen on hard times. The useful old cafeteria has been abolished and replaced by a kitchen for feeding a bunch of pesky robots. The coffee wing now opens at 10 so you can’t grab a cup of coffee on your way to work or class. I wish ASUCLA cared more about the community it’s supposed to serve.

The French Omelette sandwich is a great combination of fresh greens, eggs and the rest of delicious amenities.
The Best burger ever is actually one of the best burgers ever 😁, juicy, great sauce and perfect caramelized onions.
I think the grilled chicken sandwich was the least of our favorites.
To end with, the salmon toast was a very refreshing sandwich, the salmon is beetroot flavored salmon,, a nice twist.
I think these guys have really worked on the details and food, so takeaways should be on fire.
Ohh and the coffees were great 👍.

Just unlocked a new fave bfast dish! It was my first time trying the Shakshuka and it was amazing. The flavors of the sauce were so good and I loved the toast. It was a bit spicy but nothing I couldn’t handle with some water (take it from someone who has no tolerance to spicy food). I also had the matcha and it was good but not memorable.

Food was great but what was really amazing was their freshly brew drip coffee- I was curious which brand of beans they used. Very lovely atmosphere as well.

Healthy food with a creative twist! I would never have thought to have chili sauce on my eggs! Highly recommend the All I Avo Wanted. If you are wanting to have unique flavors, try that dish!"

We ended up sitting outside and the food and drinks were delivered to our table. Cute interior but they didn't have any empty tables. It was kind of cold outside but luckily we brought jackets, no warmers available.

I got the sun dried tomatoes quiche, which was very crisp and flavorful. My friends got the farmers omelette breakfast sandwich, and open face avocado toast- and they enjoyed it.

Coffee was good of course.

Great atmosphere. Workers are friendly. Love the outdoor seating.

Coffee was pretty good. We had a baguette with butter and jam and we really enjoyed it!

We will be back

A cute sweet cafe at the corner, music isn’t too loud and the decor is simple and tidy. Beautiful desserts (didn’t taste them) and good coffee.

Went here for my birthday and LOVED IT! The French Onion Soup was absolutely yummy. So big I shared it with my sister. The Filet Mignon was cooked perfectly (Rare Plus) and practically melted in my mouth. The Pannacotta Dessert was absolutely yummy! Just the right amount of sweetness. The ambiance was great with conversations at normal pitch. Our waitress was kind, attentive and fabulous. I'm definitely coming back here!!

Service here is amazing, people are very nice, they got so many breakfast\brunch and lunch options. Good variety of bakeries, pies, cakes and coffee as well.

Amazing food, awesome food and excellent service - highly recommended!

The food is magnificent but be prepared to pay. The food looks great and it tastes amazing.

I just had lunch there with a business associate and we decided to split the bill.   She wanted to use Apple Pay and so had to go to the register to pay.   When she came back so told me that she already added the tip so we left.   While we were waiting for her car the waitress came out and basically asked us where was her tip!  We told her that the tip was left on Apple Pay but she said it wasn’t.   Then she asked for a signature so that she could add a tip later.  Not feeling comfortable signing again I just gave her cash.    I have been to Pats many times- in fact 3 times this week, and I don’t think I should be accosted outside the restaurant for a tip!  Left me with a bad feeling."

Love to Chris! He always has positive energy every time I see him. Super polite, kind and cheerful. He makes a great Vanilla Latte- perfect every time. I’m always happy to see him 💖

Very poor service and slow barista must be fast and efficient but these guys talk n talk takes them 5 minutes to get you cream for simple coffee. Must be trained again . The store in Montana are great and fast amazing

100% better then Starbucks

Tasty croissants, perfect coffee, best tea!
Thanks guys!!!

Best coffee on the planet. Peet's coffee shop was very comfortable. The staff are extremely friendly and super fast. The coffee is excellent, I had a latte and it was perfect. I really recommend Peet's, I don't have one near me so what a treat to be here."

Mint mojito and iced rose are the bomb. Their specialities. This location a clean space with ample outdoor seating and outlets on the outside against the store front! The workers are so kind and nice, they always tell you to let them know if you need your drink adjusted. I’ve been to this location a couple times and it’s always a good time. Would recommend coming here to catch up with people or to do work for a short period of time

I don’t like pour over coffee, and this place only serves pour over coffee. It is flavorful, the staff is nice, but I prefer espresso.

Marissa makes the best coffee ever. I don’t know what she does that is so drastically different from all the other baristas but her coffee comes out insanely good every single time. She needs to be promoted and train the rest of the staff hahah"

I unfortunately had the stomach for only one dessert, but everything looked so good. Decided to try the lavender cake and it was perfectly moist inside, not overly powerful in lavender, and great proportion of cream to cake. Definitely need to try the other desserts next time.

I stumbled upon this little cake shop and wow, what a find.
The place is so cosy. The pastries in the display case were like pieces of art. I wanted to try them all but I was already pretty full from dinner, so just tried one pastry and a cup of tea. The pastry base was orange chocolate and believe some pistachio, and was delicious and buttery, and just the right amount of sweet. The tea was the perfect companion, and the whole combo hit the spot.
They also have a great selection of teas, which I thought was a nice touch.

The staff were so friendly as well

I’m planning my next visit to try more of their treats.

Pompadour is the nicest cafe and bakery I have ever been to, and the desserts are hand crafted to perfection. There is a lot of seating, and the interior and exterior is very cute. It’s like an escape as soon as you enter, you are transported to an ultra chic cafe in Paris. They have a variety of different desserts, and I tried the chocolate orange, hazelnut dome, and the kunafa, all three were a 10/10! You can’t go wrong going to pompadour, you will love everything. I will definitely be back and will be bringing all of my friends here.

This bakery is an absolute gem! The owner is incredibly kind and patient, offering thoughtful suggestions and detailed explanations about each dessert. The pastries are not only visually stunning but also incredibly delicious—like the flaky almond croissant, tangy citrus mousse tart, and perfectly balanced chocolate éclair. The warm ambiance and exceptional service make this spot a must-visit. We’ll definitely be back for more!

I had a wonderful experience at Pompadour Beverly Hills French bakery. If you haven’t visited them yet, you are missing out on an exceptional treat. You will experience the finest quality ingredients and unmatched authentic taste. I highly recommend giving Pompadour a try and you won’t be disappointed."

Located not too far from UCLA it is a great place to pop in to study. To eat we ordered avocado toast and the breakfast burrito! 🥑The toast had lots of avocado and it paired well with the drizzle of honey and radishes on top. The fired egg on top was perfect with the runny yolk and crispy edges. The breakfast burrito was packed with eggs and veggies but could of used a bit more seasoning. Also, the burritos came with a red sauce that added a nice little kick. To drink we got the mocha latte and their seasonal orange maple latte. I didn't taste too much of the orange as it was overpowered by the coffee and maple. The mocha was very frothy and had a great chocolaty taste.

Cute little coffee shop!
Came at a weekday afternoon, people in the cafe are all with a laptop either working or studying. It was quite bit also allow me to chat with friends, good for work or coffee chat! Love the vibe

I stopped by SIPP Coffee in Westwood, and it did not disappoint! I tried their vegetarian burrito, which was absolutely delicious. It was packed with fresh ingredients and had the perfect balance of flavors—definitely one of the better veggie options I've had in the area. Paired it with a matcha latte that was creamy and just the right amount of sweet. The vibe of the café is cozy and inviting, making it a great spot to chill, study, or catch up with friends. Highly recommend if you're in Westwood and looking for tasty bites and quality coffee! 🌯🍵💫

I’m so glad I found this place! It’s such a cute coffee shop and ambiance is super nice. Since they just open recently, there weren’t too many people today. That might be also because it’s relatively close to UCLA and students are in the class .
They have a good selection for breakfast, pastries and vegan options. I am a simple black coffee person so I’m always looking for a good cup of coffee and they def has one!
Stuffs are very nice too. I tried Parisian toast today and it was sooooo good!! There are number of seats inside but my favorite spot is next to the cashier’s. There is little space with open ceiling. Super cozy and cute. I would def be back!!
There are street parking with meters available so I didn’t have any issue around 10-11am but might be harder to find parking during much time or later traffic time.

Sipp coffee is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat and an amazing coffee. They made me a short Americano, which was delicious, and I had to try the saffron latte as well.

The latte art was a perfect touch on a well flavored latte that wasn't overly flavored. The Americano was delicious and full-bodied flavor.  I believe they are using Sight Glass coffee, which is a San Francisco roaster if you're into that kind of information!

Overall, great spot and worth dropping in. Pricing was on par for LA."

Good selection of food available and they taste great. The staff are patient and polite.

My sandwich was ready when I arrived after placing a mobile order, while my drink was ready soon after. There was enough room inside, but I wanted to eat outside. There were not enough tables outside, but I was able to simply go across the street. The food was as expected.

Great place to study and hang out. The new boba drinks were not bad, but not to my taste.

Blocking all the outlets is a weird anti social move. I'm sure it won't lead to loss of business due to the location of this place, but I just think that's really shitty of them, especially given they're located in a student town. Just messed up imo.

The place is clean  .

The cashier was rude. Her name is Hannah. They should educate their employees before hiring them. I won't visit again, and I'll give negative feedback about it. I understand that the manager is supposed to defend the employees, but at the same time, they're incompetent. They should be considerate of their customers. The customer comes first. Starbucks is getting worse.

This Starbucks is the best Starbucks I've been to! The employees, customers, and the managers are the sweetest. Not only did they change my public image of Starbucks, but they updated their Matcha to be the best. Great place to go and grab a drink and a bit to eat and get some work done--props to them 🙌🏼

Sat down to order on my phone and was ask am I ordering, placed a order and was never told it was ready, but to top it off was never told some of the items in my drink wasn't available, and offered no solution.

I've been to this place already 10 times and each time it closes even earlier than indicated on the paper.  Naturally, in Google it is indicated that they are open until 19:00.  Now the time is 16:24.  Naturally, I don’t advise you to come to this institution, it’s very annoying, because during the working rush hour you go through traffic jams, because you are sure that it is open, and upon arrival you understand that the employees do not have a non-working place.  Lack of responsibility and punctuality.  If you indicate that you work until 18:00, you do not need to close the establishment at one in the afternoon."

That's very rare these days, made me want to come back to this branch just as an appreciation. I wish all starbucks employees are that nice. Thank you brother, made my day

This place is horrible I order a lavender matcha latter and inside my drink there was a roach

I go to Starbucks a lot and the baristas here are always rude.Also there is a lot of homeless in the area.Once I was inside with 2 of my friends and a unhoused person was staring at us from the window and another unhoused person was sitting at the entrance.We asked the barista who was talking with her coworkers while she was taking our order if there was a different exit.She ignored us and asked us if that was it for the order. We ran out with our drinks in hand with a lady with a younger daughter and to our surprise they when to the opposite direction that me and my friends needed to go so we just ran across the street with our drinks under 5 seconds and went back to campus.If you go here make sure to take at least 2 friends with you.Also there is a different Starbucks near this location and it has kind baristas a bathroom open to public if you ask nicely and it’s location is Broxton and weyburg in Westwood(thanks for reading this if you read it.I know that it’s quite long)😁☕️

I heard two of the workers laughing  uncontrollably with each other after being rude to the e customers.

Jackie is the best! She has a patience with joyful heart. It made me smile 😃

This location does not have wall outlets. Came here to work but can’t charge my phone or laptop.

I used to go to this store on a weekly basis for years. Extremely disappointed in the new remodel. The store went from having ~15 seats and tables to having just two small tables with no outlets or anything. It is basically like a drive thru/to go store at this point. The food and service was good, but the new layout making it very difficult to work inside is very upsetting.

I’d like to commend David, Jackie, Avery and a cashier whose name is escaping me…Ellen? They are wonderful and always greet me by name and know my drink by heart. I come back for them.

The only time I hesitate and contemplate passing on getting my Starbucks for the day is when Mama D is working the register. I don’t want her to get in trouble but she’s not friendly and always corrects me when I’m ordering my drink, saying that a sugar free vanilla latte is already always made with nonfat milk when I ask for it to be nonfat and so she doesn’t put it on the ticket. This morning that happened and I asked the barista if it had nonfat milk and he said no, and I asked him to remake it, and said that I’d asked Mama D for nonfat and she deliberately didn’t put it on the ticket. Also, when I asked for cinnamon to be added she said, under her breath, “THAT’S what I need.” As if she didn’t need to hear about the nonfat milk part.

Anyways, I didn’t let this affect the score because I generally have a perfect experience and as a person who also works in customer service I understand that the industry is tough and people can be unforgiving, but this doesn’t excuse Mama D’s almost constant disagreeable demeanor. Sadly, I will avoid days when she’s at the register.

Please praise the others mentioned for their fantastic service.

The older woman mama d is one of the rudest people I’ve come across in the service industry. She has absolutely zero soft skills, and to be honest I don’t frequent this store mostly because of her. Starbucks has to do better w their hiring. If I had the energy I would call corporate

the most frendliest, welcoming Starbucks I've ever been too. Employees make my day every time I go there - so positive and sincerely warm. And they make delicious coffee!!!

thank you! :)

The worst Starbucks in California. The wait is long, the hot is cold, and the hot is cold. Terrible service! I encourage you to find another Starbucks nearby! And Manager He was Racist!

This Starbucks has the kindest employees in the world. They make our day! Special shoutout to the manager and Mama D. They make it a real neighborhood place and work so hard. Always a treat to see them."

Well… it did, I ordered a vanilla sweet cream cold brew but received an iced vanillla latte.  The bag was correct because it had my name and sticker of my drink but inside the bag it was the wrong drink.  I called the establishment 8 times and no one picked up, and on top of that someone picked up one of those times and hung up on me.

Pretty much will never order through the app again, and pretty disappointed that this happened.

I was disappointed with the service during my recent visit. After placing my coffee order, I stepped away to use the restroom. Upon returning, I noticed a cup on the counter and instinctively held it to check if it was mine. Instead of a courteous clarification, a staff member addressed me in a condescending manner, stating that I should not have touched the cup.

While I understand the importance of handling customer orders carefully, the approach could have been more professional and respectful. My hands were sanitized, yet the staff, who were not wearing gloves, made me feel embarrassed in front of other customers.

This experience reflects poor customer service. There are more polite and considerate ways to communicate with customers. I hope the management invests in proper training to ensure their staff uphold basic courtesy and professionalism, as no guest should leave feeling disrespected.

I have been placing online orders almost everyday and pick up in store.. they have always had my order ready on time and properly , staff is friendly and there is a nice patio area with seats in front of the store to sit and enjoy the coffee

What kind of stupid politics is this? The guy at the cash register today was very rude, I've been a Starbucks customer for 9 years and I didn't think they would treat customers there, I buy something every morning at different Starbucks stores and when I went to their store at lunchtime and asked to use the restroom politely the guy at the cash register refused me saying I didn't buy anything and he wouldn't let me in, it was very rude and not polite, this is bad policy guys I will never go to Starbucks again because rudeness of people who refuse basic request is not good, you lost a customer learn to be kinder.

If you are in a rush i do not recommend picking up your order at the curbside pick up. I was waiting in my car for more than 10 minutes. if the employees would stop playing around, flirting and touching each other, they would clearly see 2 cars at the curbside waiting for get our orders for more than 10 minutes. Me and another customer had to pick up our orders inside which is where we see the employees fooling around."

Friendly cashier, small location, No Drive thru. Fast to order, not busy maybe depending on the days. Meter parking or 2 hrs garage parking.

The partners at this location set the bar for what every coffee shop should strive to achieve. They're so friendly and sincere. Attentive to every detail and very informative with all your possible questions. Thank You all for making my stay  here more welcoming.

This is a great location - beats the one on north Beverly drive. It’s spacious, has beautiful outdoor seating, spacious indoor seating with outlets and there wasn’t a line when we came mid day on a Friday vs the north Beverly location had a line. We ordered a dragonfruit lemonade less ice and matcha frappacino with coconut milk. The drinks were refreshing and good - the lemonade was a bit too sweet though. Overall, would definitely come back for the vibes and ambience!!

The staff at this coffee shop doesn’t listen to what customers order. They add extra options to the bill that weren’t requested. The customer service is terrible. This isn’t the first time I’ve experienced this here!"

We had a seat inside to enjoy our drinks. I would come back.

I’ve come to this Starbucks multiple times and have never been told I needed to make a purchase to use the restroom. But when my Black boyfriend tried to use it, the barista
a super heavy set white woman immediately stopped him and loudly said he had to buy something first. He was actually planning to make a purchase, but the way she approached him felt targeted and discriminatory. I’m white and have never once been questioned or stopped like that. The difference in treatment was obvious and Christina’s rude, unprofessional behavior made the entire situation uncomfortable. Do better.

Starbucks was sued back in 2018 for a similar situation involving two Black men just trying to use the restroom. This kind of behavior should not still be happening.

The order was very polite. The barista must’ve had six hands because the drinks were coming out as fast as they were ordered.  Great service!!!

One of the worst Starbucks I've been to in the world.
The Hispanic young cashier was kind & took our order in a pleasant way. The young chubby young girl handing out the drinks was very rude, seemed she was in a bad mood. I'm not sure if Starbucks trains them but they should take lessons from Chickfila.
The restaurant was dirty and the restroom was filthy and gross!! So disgusting

This Starbucks don't make half caffeinated coffees here.
willing to accommodate the kind barista offered to make the two coffees.
This is what I did. She also offered a $4 gift card for their inconvenience. Very kind.
The manager was very rude to another customer while I was making my order.
This place looks like a Walmart when they are restocking the shelves.
Overall sad to see some of my favorite Starbucks locations going downhill with poor customer service."

Great location to cop a solid study session. There’s always seats available, satisfactory air conditioning, and the baristas are chill. Only caveat is there’s a 30 minute parking limit so you have to walk or find street parking to stay longer.

They’re doing great job! All of staffs here are very kind! A lady noticed I’ve been waiting my order for  a little longer, then she check my order and immediately made it for me, also she gave me two $4-off gift card! Appreciate you guys hard working! 👍👍

I really like the iced matcha latte, but Ultimate is putting too much ice and not enough liquid in this location. In two or three gulps the drink is gone

It’s a good Starbucks, always busy, orders are usually on time. Staff seems polite but manager have the tendency to sit in costumer area and work. Which is not an issue until they start speaking out loud on their phones about business and walking around like costumers aren’t trying to enjoy their food items.
This is a business but managers on premises need to understand that costumers do NOT want to know about business or what status the store withhold.

5 stars for the employees. Just witnessed a Beverly Hills house wife with way too much Botox and injections talk to the employees very rudely, because they accidentally added foam to her macchiato (which it comes with btw).

Great location, it was busy but they were fast. Staff were nice and location was clean.

All Team members are always kind~~😊 thanks.  Parking available behind bldg. Don't forget validation. No seating due to social distancing."

Coffee and Cappuccino were both perfect. Nice little coffee shop with merchandise for dog rescue. Also, a good selection of snacks for breakfast or lunch.

The coffee shop is tucked away inside an office building but not hard to find. The barista provided excellent service. We enjoyed the avocado toast but its spiciness may not be for everyone. The coffee was fine but not extraordinary. Indoor seating is limited.

They have a very good selection of breakfast. I enjoyed their bagel and cookies. Their coffee is not too strong which is to my liking. The place can be improved but it is still good and clean enough.

Amazing coffee place. Really recommend. It has no natural light. No windows. Pastries look 5 years old. Espresso was so strong I thought I was taking a substance. Full of processed chips and snacks. I can't wait to be back!"

Food:  The coffee here is good and has a good taste based on the roasts.  It meets the baseline.  There are lots of choices for milk alternatives and they also have grab and go food offerings.

Service:  The staff was friendly and efficient in preparing my order.  My server took great care in preparing my Latte.

Ambiance:  This location is an upscale kiosk level cafe.  It is a good place to grab coffee and walk around the Century City mall area for shopping.

The kiosk is too crowded.  The service is slow.  Iyesha was especially rude when attempting to check who was next in line. Even when I attempted to check my place, people were so rude. They purposely made my drink after several other customers. Ieysha went out of her way to make me feel bad and corrected me saying, “I was not in the right place.” They make you feel very unwelcome.   Victor Benes Bakery provides much better service with more apace at the Gelson’s downstairs.  This experience combined with The Coffee Bean not really making that good of coffee is enough to not go to the Coffee Bean again. it’s

Do not recommend!!!!
Guy said were officially closed. Then turned lights back on as we walked out. Drove a long way just to get here!!!
To manager
The bald guy behind counter was SUPER rude.
-1 star if i could

I usually visit this branch to order my coffee to go. Friendly staff and consistent reliable service.

Note: order online to avoid long waiting time. There are no seats either.

The worst experience! I ordered Avocado toast and the picture was looking good and they gave me slice of avocado on a toast . When I complained she said this is the way we do😳"

I got the frozen vanilla coffee and I asked for coffee instead of water for extra caffeine!! Also got the everything avocado and egg toast- the egg was hard boiled so that was a surprise lol but it was still tasty!! Good location too and easy going atmosphere. Good place!

Food is tasty for the most part and so are drinks but can sometimes be inconsistent in flavor depending on who makes them.

Customer care/service is usually okay but can definitely be better or needs some improvement. They can be very rude, uncooperative, unfriendly and unhelpful at times for sure. Not the best in that regard. Customer service needs major help. They should do better. Their management needs to care more.

The inside atmosphere is a little small/tight, more comfortable outside seating would be nice.

This is the worst coffee I have ever had in my life. The lady at the counter was anything but friendly. The chocolate muffin was delicious, but that is all I can say that is good. I will not ever go back again.

Went there today for some coffee.. Luis was so nice and helpful.. I really appreciated the customer service.

This place has just an amazing iced coffee and tea blend! We got the caramel flavored one 😋🤤. There’s a nice little area outside to enjoy the drink and food. There are kosher options if you ask to see the kosher symbols on the bottles 👌🏻"

The Landmark Cafe invited me to stop by for my IG food blog (@catrinoms), and I had a wonderful experience! The space is so beautiful and serene, and they have a great variety of coffee, tea, and juice drinks, as well as sandwiches, wraps, salads, and even fresh baked goods. Everything I tried was absolutely delicious, but I was especially impressed with the dragonfruit juice, as I don’t see that in many places. Overall, definitely recommend for breakfast or lunch if you’re in the area!

Entering this snug cafe is like discovering a secret oasis amidst the hustle and bustle of the city. The tantalizing scent of freshly brewed coffee instantly captivates your senses, promising a delightful experience ahead. Grateful for the impeccable service that enhances every visit!

Bland food. I had the breakfast quesadilla and it was the most average breakfast quesadilla I've ever had. This was my second time eating there and I don't think there will be a third time.

One star did not make it because presentation of the egg is flawed. There are cracks in 2 flowers because the whole egg wasn’t aligned at center. The paint behind the flower petals is missing as well. Looks like ruched work for presentation. Haven’t tasted it yet but expect it will be delicious. Will update review if needed.

We popped in for a desperately needed caffeine boost and we weren't let down. Service was helpful and prompt and the courtyard is a great place to wind down. Also of special note, there were public open restrooms just the other side of the courtyard that we used and were well maintained.

The place is so cute I enjoy sitting outside on the courtyard but the service is non existent they come so late then when they take the order they don’t come back for another 30 mins. The food isn’t even good for a 5 star hotel and when the burger is $30 you expect the food to be good at least

First time here. The food we ordered was not worth the money we paid for it: a salmon bagel and an avocado toast with some coffee… but

The atmosphere, the service, the overall vibe and cuteness beats everything. Amazing location, beautiful everything. Loved this place!

It's a lovely spot for a casual lunch with comfortable seating outside. Unfortunately,we were unable to get a table outside, but the inside of the restaurant also had its charm. We can highly recommend their orange latte (especially with oatmilk), the chickpea wrap (to die for!), the asian kale was pretty good,and the hamburger was decent but we had better ones in the past. The scones were okay, but again, we had better ones in the past. Overall, it's a cute place for a casual lunch."

Nice residence hall with a study hall called 'The Study' where students can do their school work and eat at the same time.  There are a few food booths like Chipotle (if im not.mistaken), cafe bakery, etc. And a little market where they offer ready made sandwiches, salads, parfait, combo.meals, etc.

I don’t know what’s up with these portion sizes but he filled the bowl halfway. Idk if im being needy but these used to be full (second pic). The lady who was calling the number didn’t give me dressing or a drink, which is included. And for the sandwiches, they always forget something:(

Best take out restaurant at ucla. Everything is so good and fresh, also perfect atmosphere to study if you like busy coffee shop vibes.

Best place for food on campus, only balanced by the fact that it's a ways uphill from most res halls. It has build your own style sandwiches, sausages, pizzas, and salads, along with other specialties. The breakfast and brunch menus don't include sandwiches, but do have bagel sandwiches which are almost as good. Also has a small prepackaged section if time is of the essence."

Such a warm and lovely place, just like the LA sunshine outside. Go get a coffee and grab a seat by the window, I bet your friends would envy your work setup!

Upside Down is a great coffee shop for relaxing, studying, or enjoying community events. They have incredible drinks, from delicious black coffee to an ever changing menu of seasonal drinks. The staff is friendly and excellently trained. The space has incredible local art and hosts gallery openings.

Their mocha is the best I’ve ever had. I always come here for it, and I really like the events they have, like unplug nights and challah bread making! It’s really focused on community and that comes through in their concept design. So happy UCLA has this place next door!

It’s a nice open spacious lounge area and is a way better deal and theory than Starbucks. The employees here are super friendly and make my day as I’m getting to know them. I stop by here regularly to say hi to the employees, hangout, and possibly get a drink. They even have a table with legos and puzzles which is a good way to cope with stress. The people I’ve met here such as Kara, Abigail, Alexa, and Rachel are amazing and make my day. They even remember me and they say my name. For those who want a coffee in Westwood, come to Upside Down and don’t bother going to Starbucks.

Rose latte & a banana pecan muffin. The latte with Rose was very delicious, slightly sweet with a very mild hint of rose but it tasted great! They have some cool lids too that let out a good amount of drink. Got it iced as recommended. The banana pecan muffin was awesome, very fluffy soft with delicious flavor. It was very busy when I went but they work fast. Parking available on the streets and some parking lots. Plenty if tables and seats inside. Prices are fair & staff was pleasant."

A nice place to meet up with friends. Delicious, fresh, healthy menu items. Fancy drinks. High quality food. There is a small indoor dining space, and much more outdoor space. Best for couples, but not large groups.

Visited for Sunday brunch and ordered a matcha latte, cappuccino, and the wild mushroom pizza. Unfortunately, they were out of pancakes which was a bit of a letdown—but the food we did get was absolutely delicious. We sat outdoors by the fire heater, which made the experience cozy and pleasant. As always, the place was bustling with energy and full of life - a lively spot that’s consistently a favorite.

WE LOVE URTH.

We’ve only had coffee and pastries. However, the food looks fresh and healthy.

The Churro Delight is my absolute favorite. My husband brings one home for me every trip.

We prefer the hot lattes over the iced ones here at urth.

Always busy but never had an issue with finding a seat.

We had breakfast/brunch with friends at Urth Caffe Beverly Hills and really enjoyed our experience. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and the service was fast and efficient. The food was delicious—fresh, flavorful, and nicely presented. It’s a great spot to relax and catch up with friends, especially on a weekend morning. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a quality brunch in a vibrant, comfortable setting.

Had a great experience at Urth Caffé. I ordered the avocado pizza, which was nothing like I have had before. The ingredients tasted high quality, and the portion was just right. I sat outside next to the heaters, which made for a cozy and comfortable atmosphere. Even though it was busy, the service was friendly and efficient. Definitely a solid spot for a relaxed meal with good food and a nice ambiance."

Great environment. Spacious indoor, nice outdoor garden, and a nice front patio with a view of the street.

Great place for coffee lovers. Nice coffee, great food and excellent service ☕️👏

Great and vibrant place that opens very early!

We tried avocado on toast, it was very tasty but the bread was so hard to chew. We also had the breakfast sandwich, pain au chocolate and almond croissant which were all great.

The coffee tasted delicious too! Seating is uncomfortable.

Espresso here came recommended by a fellow espresso  aficionado. Like Vergano, Verve gets it, their espresso is top notch, the way they have it roasted. We really enjoyed our flat whites, as is, no sugar, no sweeteners, just amazing. Nice job, you-all knocked it out of the park!

Terrific pastries and rich chai lattes! I came here after walking past many times and boy was I happily surprised. The vibe here is very much social with the outdoor space being a bit more relaxed. The staff is very kind and attentive. The drinks and food are averagely priced, but the quality is absolutely great. Definitely plan to visit this shop again!"
